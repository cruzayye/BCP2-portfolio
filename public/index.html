                <p class ="notes">So you want to learn about code huh? If you enjoy not having an idea about what you’re doing and your pretty decent at maneuvering your way through google to find your answers, then you chose the right field. If you have no Idea what type of coding you want to dive into, figure out what technology you want to learn...Do you want to make video games for Nintendo or Playstation? Then you would want to look into <span>c++, c#</span> and <span>java</span>. Want to learn about data management, working with tables and using that information in a unique way such as portraying stats? <span>SQL or Python<span> are whee its at.  If you’re like me and you're looking into designing websites and web applications then you’re going to start with html/css, then move onto <span>javascrtipt<span>, which makes websites more robust and intuitive.  Since I’m a front end developer Heres my secret: 
                        <ol class ="notes sites">

                                        Learn the basics of HTML/CSS for free at <a href= "https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/">  khan Academy </a> Look for the section about creating webpages. 
            
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                        Make a website. Start with a simple gallery of images with a 3 rows and 3 columns or something better you can come up with. There are several tutorials out there, use your google skills to find the right one. 
                                </li>

                                        Learn JS and practice everyday. There are so many websites as resources out there that its hard to choose. Check out these 3 sites. What's awesome about Udemy is that they provide full on courses and have sales all the time where the course turns out to be less than $15.00. Theres a lot of hype around freecodecamp as well and I sometimes use it as a reference.

                <p class ="notes">	Toughest part about learning on your own is discipline and holding yourself accountable. No one’s going to tell you what you have to do as far as staying consistent so it’s easier to just tell yourself that you’ll get to it eventually, but Soon enough eventually becomes never. If this is your issue check to see if theirs an in person bootcamp in your city. Being around coders will help you make connections and push you further. Personally I don't think I would have learned as much online because my lack of discipline, but thats just me, chances are you're a lot more self motiated than me. Don’t get discouraged to join an online bootcamp, the right one will have a course that gets you to build projects that lead into a plehora amount of knowledge. BUT PLEASE DO YOUR RESEARCH because not all of them are going to give you the tools and knowledge to prep you for a job. If I never joined a bootcamp I would have never considered learning github, SQL, the command line and practicing code on sites like <a href ="https://www.codewars.com/">Codewars</a> and <a href="https://codesignal.com/">Codesignal.</a> Long story short DO YOUR RESEARCH, commit and code everyday!</p>

                    <p class ="notes">Never did I think I would be a podcast listener but if you want to keep up with this fast paced industry where the learning never stops, you're going to have to divulge yourself with everything about coding. listening to podcasts over my gangster rap music has made me more fluent when it comes to talking code as well as given me ideas for my code. There will be many times where I got done learning a new subject such as Test Driven Development and I had no idea what the heck Just read, but then I run into a podcast on that subject which answers a lot of my questions. There was also another time that I was listening to a coding podcast and I needed help with an ajax call. The TA went off into talking about promises which I was able to quickly catch on because the podcast (syntax) had mentioned the promise method on my drive to class.  Here are a list of podcasts I listen to off of Spotify:
