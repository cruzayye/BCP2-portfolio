                    <h2>A Little About Johnny Cruz</h2>
                    <p>Woah... Thanks for showing interest my page. My names Johnny and I'm a full stack developer with a passion for Design. About a year ago I was working on some graphic design projects as a freelancer and I realized that if I ever wanted to take my digital content to the next level I was going to have to learn how to code and create web pages. I heard about online coding boot camps but I wanted a program that was face to face and personable. During my research, I came across Alchemy Code lab which is a local boot camp in downtown Portland, OR and joining this program was the best decision I've made all of 2018. I've spent my last 6 months (over 1000 hours) Learning Everything about JS. One thing I've realized is that the learning never stops and I will forever be a student. I enjoy learning new technologies and overall just leveling up my current skills. I hope I to help create appealing and intuitive applications for the world to use. Besides trying to be tech savvy I enjoy playing video games(currently stuck on Fortnite), jamming out to music(currently learning to play guitar) and playing basketball(currently trying to play more like Dame Lillard).  I'm glad to answer any of your tech questions, so please don't be shy!

                    <h2 class="blogTitle">Light Intro to Backend Development</h2>
                    <p class="notes">Long story short Backend Development is working with databases and dealing with sending and receiving data(http requests), but if your want a bit more info please continue reading...</br>
                        Before this year, I knew that when it came to web development, there are 3 types of developers:
                        backend developers, front end developers and fullstack developers. While front end devs focus on
                        making sites look pretty and everything HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Backend devs deal with JS
                        algorithms as well as working with servers, including retrieving users names passwords and
                        information that the website handles. This leads to us to the topic of HTTP Methods aka CRUD,
                        which is short for 'create', read, update and delete. okay... but how is this used? Let's use
                        Instagram for example since that's what us millennials are into. When we open up the app and go
                        to the home page to look at everyone's post we tapping into Instagram's database and asking it
                        to <strong>GET</strong> data for us, which means that the developers have to make a function
                        that lists all of the new posts that our friends have posted when we click the home icon. Have
                        you ever thought about what kind of method is used to 'upload' a picture? Well, when uploading
                        or creating any kind of content for the world to see we use a <stong>POST</stong> method to send
                        new information to the server. What about to delete? well, you guessed it <strong>
                            DELETE</strong>. Another commonly used method would be <strong>PATCH</strong>, or
                        <strong>PUT</strong> which wouldn't be used for a picture but for a comment. For example, you
                        might have made typo; sometimes we might spell a word so wrong on our smartphone that
                        autocorrect isn't even able to correct it. If you're considering getting started with Backend
                        development and be able to dabble with these CRUD methods You're going to have to look into <a
                            href="https://www.nodebeginner.org/"> Node</a>. This link is a deep introductory to Node JS
                        is the javascript framework that lets us do backend development. Once you get done with that

                        then you chose the right field. If you have no Idea what type of coding you want to dive into,
                        figure out what technology you want to learn...Do you want to make video games for Nintendo or
                        Playstation? Then you would want to look into <span>c++, c#</span> and <span>java</span>. Want
                        to learn about data management, working with tables and using that information in a unique way
                        such as portraying stats? <span>SQL or Python<span> are whee its at. If you’re like me and
                                you're looking into designing websites and web applications then you’re going to start
                                with html/css, then move onto <span>javascrtipt<span>, which makes websites more robust
                                        and intuitive. Since I’m a front end developer Heres my secret:

                                                Make a website. Start with a simple gallery of images with a 3 rows and
                                                3 columns or something better you can come up with. There are several

                                                out there that its hard to choose. Check out these 3 sites. What's
                                                awesome about Udemy is that they provide full on courses and have sales
                                                all the time where the course turns out to be less than $15.00. Theres a
                                                lot of hype around freecodecamp as well and I sometimes use it as a
                                                reference.

                    <p class="notes"> Toughest part about learning on your own is discipline and holding yourself
                        accountable. No one’s going to tell you what you have to do as far as staying consistent so it’s
                        easier to just tell yourself that you’ll get to it eventually, but Soon enough eventually
                        becomes never. If this is your issue check to see if theirs an in person bootcamp in your city.
                        Being around coders will help you make connections and push you further. Personally I don't
                        think I would have learned as much online because my lack of discipline, but thats just me,
                        chances are you're a lot more self motiated than me. Don’t get discouraged to join an online
                        bootcamp, the right one will have a course that gets you to build projects that lead into a
                        plehora amount of knowledge. BUT PLEASE DO YOUR RESEARCH because not all of them are going to
                        give you the tools and knowledge to prep you for a job. If I never joined a bootcamp I would
                        have never considered learning github, SQL, the command line and practicing code on sites like
                        <a href="https://www.codewars.com/">Codewars</a> and <a
                            href="https://codesignal.com/">Codesignal.</a> Long story short DO YOUR RESEARCH, commit and
                        code everyday!</p>

                    <p class="notes">Never did I think I would be a podcast listener but if you want to keep up with
                        this fast paced industry where the learning never stops, you're going to have to divulge
                        yourself with everything about coding. listening to podcasts over my gangster rap music has made
                        me more fluent when it comes to talking code as well as given me ideas for my code. There will
                        be many times where I got done learning a new subject such as Test Driven Development and I had
                        no idea what the heck Just read, but then I run into a podcast on that subject which answers a
                        lot of my questions. There was also another time that I was listening to a coding podcast and I
                        needed help with an ajax call. The TA went off into talking about promises which I was able to
                        quickly catch on because the podcast (syntax) had mentioned the promise method on my drive to
                        class. Here are a list of podcasts I listen to off of Spotify:

                            <li>Sytax</li>
