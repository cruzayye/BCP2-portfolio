<!-- Take aways: 
1. this is used when referencing a key a key (js)

2. finally understad what prototype does. instead of writing propertyies to all object which would take at least 5-10 for each instance we only need to write it once. I had 30 minutes to use elsewhere!

3. it is not good practice to write text straight into a div without a <p> tag or else you wont be able to add a h1 or any other tags, only below it. 

4. why each individiual project page through js?
